loneliness feel one not ask question case offend listener find oneself speak much silly things oneself  fill silent moments  this  turn  make one look self centered careless other  no matter much one rather say prove contrary  i realise fell loneliness i observe intelligent mother last ten years life  lose hearing  try hard pretend fine i not worry father who also become difficult isolate spend  hours day watch tv  not reading much any more  not feeling interested about any one but for politeness  and sleeping  understood that loneliness began to creep up on me sporadically and that was on the same road as my parents  my car had the engine on  i do not want to put in the first gear  my loneliness accelerated when began to lose my central vision  realised that my peripheral dreams would probably never be achieve  dreamed too much and did not enough for myself to myself my children and others were a priority  on the other hand  if and not done so  would have fhat so so so guilty  would have felt the reason of my love ones disappointment  so  now  still work many hours per week at my  years of age  the strange thing is that feel more lonely when do not work  teach foreign languages at home as cannot drive or teach in a classroom would not be able to control the class properly and would not be able to help with my granddaughter who are still in primary school  they mother  my middle daughter  is a wonderful mother to them  they love her so much that they write notes and letters many times a week to tell her how amazing she is and how much they love her  this makes me wonder why do not remember receiving those kinds of letter from my own daughters but for my birthday  why did do wrong  adored them  my life was entirely focused on their well being  their education and their hobbies which they absolutely loved and for which have received thanks many many times since then till right now  still  feel lonely because do not think my daughters really care about me  must have been a tough mother and now am paying for it  they are fine but they are also extremely quick picking on everything they thing do and have done wrongly  think that my loneliness stems from the lack of love they show towards me  do not need presents  do not need works  only need a bit of kindness in their approach towards me  so  my whatever bad bad mother have been  do not see how  has come back against me with revenge  do not feel relaxed with my own daughters as am constantly worried they will snap up against me at any comment may make  no matter what  feel as they are so angry against me  that they are instinctively on the watch out to find a reason to attack me and remind me how badly handled their education  how exaggerated was and how hard on them about their lack of tidiness  about not allow them to sleepovers  or about checking their whereabouts and offer to pick them up when it was late  for safety reasons of course  about me criticising their friends or some of them that  they say  overtly made comments about stupid behaviour with binge drinking or over the top make up and how it annoyed me that they tried to convince my daughters to do the same against my will  etc  to begin with  for years  thought that happened to most mothers and took no notice of teri comments later on in life  now they are in their thirties and forties and still hear the same or similar comments  even if two of them already have children themselves of school age  also notice that cannot correct my granddaughters when they do something incorrect as their mother  my daughter  immediately contradicts me in front of the children and calls me stupid woman if try to explain why was correcting them  she even insults me with unpleasant words that think she must have learnt from my ex husband who always has a very flowery vocabulary  the point am tryparticularly when drunk  main reason for my divorce about  years going to make is that feel lonely simply because tried to give my heart and soul for the benefit of my children and it is they  the ones did it for  who despise me constantly  who make me feel uncomfortable with them  who correct me rudely the minimum thing how cook  how speak  how eat  what believe  how dress  how do not look after myself  how to do almost breath and  whatever they buy me  and they do for birthdays and christmas  should absolutely show total adoration or they think am an ungrateful old bag  on the other hand  if gel i something and is not what they like or need  they can criticise me pointing out that i do not pay attention to what they like  they try to show gratitude  but i do not feel they mean it  this is the origin of my loneliness  i do apologise because i cannot see whit letters i am writing and i do not know if i want to check it all  i just realised that i worth in capitals  i apologise  oh  another reason i feel lonely is my brother  he lives far away from me  he comes accross as a very capable and intelligent man of over sixty he has been the youngest of the three of us  i being the middle and the only girl from a very macho chauvinistic country  specially at the time when i was growing up  my brother treats me as a lovely wonderful achieving woman who has gone through a lot  as they say  but  at the same time and at unexpected i times and for reasons he only must understand  he talks to me as if were a stupid old woman  even if may be dealing with difficult emotional issues that he confesses cannot bear for more that a few minutes  such as my parents last years  particularly their last months and after their death  as am writing  am getting to the conclusion that must become just a rad more selfish and phone my friends and see them much more often  regardless of my family obligations  love dancing and have not done it since began to lose my sight eight years ago  need music  need jazz and rock and roll  need to paint anything regardless of the cost of the acrylic paints my own daughters gave me years ago  need to find a course to design clothes efficiently which is what have always wanted to do a  need not to think about my own existence and lett it pass while do what i really like  this journey of living is like a long cruise when some of us are the crew all the time and never stop  others are the sunbathes and eaters  others produce at the same times they enjoy other tings  and others just watch it all pass as observers who become depressed because they never got up and tried to do it all on time of it  do not think am one of those  but still do not feel have tried what may  just may be able to do best  ,8.0
